	Abstract = {Pattern discovery techniques, such as association rule discovery, explore large search spaces of potential patterns to find those that satisfy some user-specified constraints. Due to the large number of patterns considered, they suffer from an extreme risk of type-1 error, that is, of finding patterns that appear due to chance alone to satisfy the constraints on the sample data. This paper proposes techniques to overcome this problem by applying well-established statistical practices. These allow the user to enforce a strict upper limit on the risk of experimentwise error. Empirical studies demonstrate that standard pattern discovery techniques can discover numerous spurious patterns when applied to random data and when applied to real-world data result in large numbers of patterns that are rejected when subjected to sound statistical evaluation. They also reveal that a number of pragmatic choices about how such tests are performed can greatly affect their power.},

	Abstract = {Statistical dependency analysis is the basis of all empirical science. A commonly occurring problem is to find the most significant dependency rules, which describe either positive or negative dependencies between categorical attributes. For example, in medical science one is interested in genetic factors, which can either predispose or prevent diseases. The requirement of statistical significance is essential, because the discoveries should hold also in the future data. Typically, the significance is estimated either by Fisher's exact test or the #x03C7;2-measure. The problem is computationally very difficult, because the number of all possible dependency rules increases exponentially with the number of attributes. As a solution, different kinds of restrictions and heuristics have been applied, but a general, scalable search method has been missing. In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for searching for the top-K globally optimal dependency rules using Fisher's exact test as a measure function. The rules can express either positive or negative dependencies between a set of positive attributes and a single consequent attribute. The algorithm is based on an application of the branch- and-bound search strategy, supplemented by several pruning properties. Especially, we prove a new lower-bound for the Fisher's p, and introduce a new effective pruning principle. The general search algorithm is applicable to other goodness measures, like the #x03C7;2-measure, as well. According to our experiments on classical benchmark data, the algorithm is well scalable and can efficiently handle even dense and high dimensional data sets. In addition, the quality of rules is significantly better than with the #x03C7;2-measure using the same search algorithm.},

In medical science, for example, one is interested in genetic factors, which can either predispose or prevent diseases. The requirement of statistical significance is essential, because the discoveries should hold also in future data.

The problem is computationally very difficult, because the number of all possible dependency rules increases exponentially with the number of attributes. As a solution, different kinds of restrictions and heuristics have been applied, but a general, scalable search method has been missing. In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm, called Kingfisher, for searching for the best non-redundant dependency rules with statistical significance measures. The rules can express either positive or negative dependencies between a set of positive attributes and a single consequent attribute. The algorithm itself is independent from the used goodness measure, but we concentrate on Fisher's exact test and the χ 2 -measure. The algorithm is based on an application of the branch-and-bound search strategy, supplemented by several pruning properties. Especially, we prove a new lower bound for Fisher's p and introduce a new effective pruning principle. According to our experiments on classical benchmark data, the algorithm is well scalable and can efficiently handle even dense and high-dimensional data sets. An interesting observation was that Fisher's exact test did not only produce more reliable rules than the χ 2 -measure, but it also performed the search much faster.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose algorithms for generation of frequent item sets by successive construction of the nodes of a lexicographic tree of item sets. We discuss different strategies in generation and traversal of the lexicographic tree such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, or a combination of the two. These techniques provide different trade-offs in terms of the I/O, memory, and computational time requirements. We use the hierarchical structure of the lexicographic tree to successively project transactions at each node of the lexicographic tree and use matrix counting on this reduced set of transactions for finding frequent item sets. We tested our algorithm on both real and synthetic data. We provide an implementation of the tree projection method which is up to one order of magnitude faster than other recent techniques in the literature. The algorithm has a well-structured data access pattern which provides data locality and reuse of data for multiple levels of the cache. We also discuss methods for parallelization of the TreeProjection algorithm.},

	Abstract = { The performance of an algorithm that mines frequent sets from transactional databases may severely depend on the specific features of the data being analyzed. Moreover, some architectural characteristics of the computational platform used - e.g. the available main memory - can dramatically change its runtime behavior. In this paper we present DCI (Direct Count Intersect), an efficient algorithm for discovering frequent sets from large databases. Due to the multiple heuristics strategies adopted, DCI can adapt its behavior not only to the features of the specific computing platform, but also to the features of the dataset being mined, so that it results very effective in mining both short and long patterns from sparse and dense datasets. Finally we also discuss the parallelization strategies adopted in the design of ParDCI, a distributed and multi-threaded implementation of DCI.},

@inproceedings{teodoro10,
	Abstract = {Frequent itemset mining (FIM) is a core operation for several data mining applications as association rules computation, correlations, document classification, and many others, which has been extensively studied over the last decades. Moreover, databases are becoming increasingly larger, thus requiring a higher computing power to mine them in reasonable time. At the same time, the advances in high performance computing platforms are transforming them into hierarchical parallel environments equipped with multi-core processors and many-core accelerators, such as GPUs. Thus, fully exploiting these systems to perform FIM tasks poses as a challenging and critical problem that we address in this paper. We present efficient multi-core and GPU accelerated parallelizations of the Tree Projection, one of the most competitive FIM algorithms. The experimental results show that our Tree Projection implementation scales almost linearly in a CPU shared-memory environment after careful optimizations, while the GPU versions are up to 173 times faster than standard the CPU version.},

While most feature subset selection methods use statistical techniques to preprocess the labeled datasets, these methods are generally not linked with the combinatorial properties of the final solutions. We prove that it is NP -hard to obtain an appropriate set of thresholds that will transform a given dataset into a binary instance of a robust feature subset selection problem. We address this problem using an evolutionary algorithm that learns the appropriate value of the thresholds. The empirical evaluation shows that robust subset of genes can be obtained. This evaluation is done using real data corresponding to the gene expression of lymphomas.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter we present a method based on the ( α , β )- k -feature set problem for identifying relevant attributes in high-dimensional datasets for classification purposes. We present a case-study of biomedical interest. Using the gene expression of thousands of genes, we show that the method can give a reduced set that can identify samples as belonging to prostate cancer tumors or not. We thus address the need of finding novel methods that can deal with classification problems that involve feature selection from several thousand features, while we only have on the order of one hundred samples. The methodology appears to be very robust in this prostate cancer case study. It has lead to the identification of a set of differentially expressed genes that are highly predictive of the cells transition to a more malignant type, thus departing from the profile which is characteristic of its originating tissue. Although the method is presented with a particular bioinformatics application in mind, it can clearly be used in other domains. A biological analysis illustrates on the relevance of the genes found, and links to the most current developments in prostate cancer biomarker studies.},

<title>Background</title>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease with a huge cost to human lives. The impact of the disease is also a growing concern for the governments of developing countries, in particular due to the increasingly high number of elderly citizens at risk. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, a common term for memory loss and other cognitive impairments. There is no current cure for AD, but there are drug and non-drug based approaches for its treatment. In general the drug-treatments are directed at slowing the progression of symptoms. They have proved to be effective in a large group of patients but success is directly correlated with identifying the disease carriers at its early stages. This justifies the need for timely and accurate forms of diagnosis via molecular means. We report here a 5-protein biomarker molecular signature that achieves, on average, a 96% total accuracy in predicting clinical AD. The signature is composed of the abundances of IL-1α, IL-3, EGF, TNF-α and G-CSF.</p>

<title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
<p>Our results are based on a recent molecular dataset that has attracted worldwide attention. Our paper illustrates that improved results can be obtained with the abundance of only five proteins. Our methodology consisted of the application of an integrative data analysis method. This four step process included: a) abundance quantization, b) feature selection, c) literature analysis, d) selection of a classifier algorithm which is independent of the feature selection process. These steps were performed without using any sample of the test datasets. For the first two steps, we used the application of Fayyad and Irani's discretization algorithm for selection and quantization, which in turn creates an instance of the (alpha-beta)-k-Feature Set problem; a numerical solution of this problem led to the selection of only 10 proteins.</p>

<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>the previous study has provided an extremely useful dataset for the identification of AD biomarkers. However, our subsequent analysis also revealed several important facts worth reporting:</p>
<p>1. A 5-protein signature (which is a subset of the 18-protein signature of Ray <italic>et al.</italic>) has the same overall performance (when using the same classifier).</p>
<p>2. Using more than 20 different classifiers available in the widely-used Weka software package, our 5-protein signature has, on average, a smaller prediction error indicating the independence of the classifier and the robustness of this set of biomarkers (i.e. 96% accuracy when predicting AD against non-demented control).</p>
<p>3. Using very simple classifiers, like Simple Logistic or Logistic Model Trees, we have achieved the following results on 92 samples: 100 percent success to predict Alzheimer's Disease and 92 percent to predict Non Demented Control on the AD dataset.</p>

	Abstract = {In this paper, we give a new algorithm for enumerating all maximal frequent sets using dualization. Frequent sets in transaction data has been used for computing association rules. Maximal frequent sets are important in representing frequent sets in a compact form, thus many researchers have proposed algorithms for enumerating maximal frequent sets. Among these algorithms, some researchers proposed algorithms for enumerating both maximal frequent sets and minimal infrequent sets in a primal-dual way by using a computation of the minimal transversal for a hypergraph, or in other words, hypergraph dualization. We give an improvement for this kind of algorithms in terms of the number of queries of frequency and the space complexity. Our algorithm checks each minimal infrequent set just once, while the existing algorithms check more than once, possibly so many times. Our algorithm does not store the minimal infrequent sets in memory, while the existing algorithms have to store them. The main idea of the improvement is that minimal infrequent sets computed from maximal frequent sets by dualization is still minimal infrequent even if we add a set to the current maximal frequent sets. We analyze the query complexity and the space complexity of our algorithm theoretically, and experimentally evaluate the algorithm to show that the computation time on average is in the order of the multiplication of the number of maximal frequent sets and the number of minimal infrequent sets.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Identifying effective drug combinations that significantly improve over single agents is a challenging problem. Pairwise combinations already represent a huge screening effort. Beyond two drug combinations the task seems unfeasible.RESULTS:In this work we introduce a method to uncover drug combinations with a putative effective response when presented to a heterogeneous population of malignant agents (strains), such as cancer cell lines or viruses. Using data quantifying the effect of single drugs over several individual strains, we search for minimal drug combinations that successfully target all strains. We show that the latter problem can be mapped to a minimal hitting set problem in mathematics. We illustrate this approach using data for the NCI60 panel of tumor derived cell lines, uncovering 14 anticancer drug combinations.CONCLUSION:The drug-response graph and the associated minimal hitting set method can be used to uncover effective drug combinations in anticancer drug screens and drug development programs targeting heterogeneous populations of infectious agents such as HIV.},

	Abstract = {
                <p>Therapies consisting of a combination of agents are an attractive proposition,
                    especially in the context of diseases such as cancer, which can manifest with a
                    variety of tumor types in a single case. However uncovering usable drug
                    combinations is expensive both financially and temporally. By employing
                    computational methods to identify candidate combinations with a greater
                    likelihood of success we can avoid these problems, even when the amount of data
                    is prohibitively large. H<sc>itting</sc> S<sc>et</sc> is a combinatorial problem
                    that has useful application across many fields, however as it is
                    <italic>NP</italic>-complete it is traditionally considered hard to solve
                    exactly. We introduce a more general version of the problem
                        (<italic>α,β,d</italic>)-H<sc>itting</sc> S<sc>et</sc>,
                    which allows more precise control over how and what the hitting set targets.
                    Employing the framework of Parameterized Complexity we show that despite being
                        <italic>NP</italic>-complete, the
                        (<italic>α,β,d</italic>)-H<sc>itting</sc> S<sc>et</sc>
                    problem is fixed-parameter tractable with a kernel of size <italic>O</italic>(α<italic>dk<sup>d</sup></italic>) when we parameterize by the size <italic>k</italic> of the
                    hitting set and the maximum number α of the minimum number of hits,
                    and taking the maximum degree <italic>d</italic> of the target sets as a
                    constant. We demonstrate the application of this problem to multiple drug
                    selection for cancer therapy, showing the flexibility of the problem in
                    tailoring such drug sets. The fixed-parameter tractability result indicates that
                    for low values of the parameters the problem can be solved quickly using exact
                    methods. We also demonstrate that the problem is indeed practical, with
                    computation times on the order of 5 seconds, as compared to previous Hitting Set
                    applications using the same dataset which exhibited times on the order of 1 day,
                    even with relatively relaxed notions for what constitutes a low value for the
                    parameters. Furthermore the existence of a kernelization for
                        (<italic>α,β,d</italic>)-H<sc>itting</sc> S<sc>et</sc>
                    indicates that the problem is readily scalable to large datasets.</p>

	Abstract = {Efficient algorithms for mining frequent itemsets are crucial for
mining association rules as well as for many other data mining tasks. Methods
for mining frequent itemsets have been implemented using a prefix-tree
structure, known as an FP-tree, for storing compressed information about
frequent itemsets. Numerous experimental results have demonstrated that these
algorithms perform extremely well. In this paper, we present a novel FP-array
technique that greatly reduces the need to traverse FP-trees, thus obtaining
significantly improved performance for FP-tree-based algorithms. Our technique
works especially well for sparse data sets. Furthermore, we present new
algorithms for mining all, maximal, and closed frequent itemsets. Our algorithms
use the FP-tree data structure in combination with the FP-array technique
efficiently and incorporate various optimization techniques. We also present
experimental results comparing our methods with existing algorithms. The results
show that our methods are the fastest for many cases. Even though the algorithms
consume much memory when the data sets are sparse, they are still the fastest
ones when the minimum support is low. Moreover, they are always among the

	Abstract = {The application of frequent patterns in classification
appeared in sporadic studies and achieved initial success in the
classification of relational data, text documents and graphs. In this
paper, we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based
classification, and provide solid reasons supporting this methodology.
It was well known that feature combinations (patterns) could capture
more underlying semantics than single features. However, inclusion of
infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due to
their limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern
frequency and discriminative measures such as information gain and
Fisher score, we develop a strategy to set minimum support in frequent
pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on this strategy,
coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm, discriminative
frequent patterns can be generated for building high quality
classifiers. We demonstrate that the frequent pattern-based
classification framework can achieve good scalability and high accuracy
in classifying large datasets. Empirical studies indicate that
significant improvement in classification accuracy is achieved (up to
12\% in UCI datasets) using the so-selected discriminative frequent
patterns.},

@article{wang06,
	Abstract = {Many studies have shown that rule-based classifiers perform well in
classifying categorical and sparse high-dimensional databases. However, a
fundamental limitation with many rule-based classifiers is that they find the
rules by employing various heuristic methods to prune the search space and
select the rules based on the sequential database covering paradigm. As a
result, the final set of rules that they use may not be the globally best rules
for some instances in the training database. To make matters worse, these
algorithms fail to fully exploit some more effective search space pruning
methods in order to scale to large databases. In this paper, we present a new
classifier, HARMONY, which directly mines the final set of classification rules.
HARMONY uses an instance-centric rule-generation approach and it can assure
that, for each training instance, one of the highest-confidence rules covering
this instance is included in the final rule set, which helps in improving the
overall accuracy of the classifier. By introducing several novel search
strategies and pruning methods into the rule discovery process, HARMONY also has
high efficiency and good scalability. Our thorough performance study with some
large text and categorical databases has shown that HARMONY outperforms many
well-known classifiers in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency
and scales well with regard to the database size},

However, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased

confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed
based on a weighted chi;2 analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our
extensive experiments on 26 databases from the UCI machine learning database

	Abstract = {Emerging patterns (EPs) are itemsets whose supports change
significantly from one dataset to another; they were recently proposed to
capture multi-attribute contrasts between data classes, or trends over time. In
this paper we propose a new classifier, CAEP, using the following main ideas
based on EPs: (i) Each EP can sharply differentiate the class membership of a
(possibly small) fraction of instances containing the EP, due to the big
difference between its supports in the opposing classes; we define the
differentiating power of the EP in terms of the supports and their ratio, on
instances containing the EP. (ii) For each instance t , by aggregating the
differentiating power of a fixed, automatically selected set of EPs, a score is
obtained for each class. The scores for all classes are normalized and the
largest score determines t 's class. CAEP is suitable for many applications,
even those with large volumes of high (e.g. 45) dimensional data; it does not
depend on dimension reduction on data; and it is usually equally accurate on all
classes even if their populations are unbalanced. Experiments show that CAEP has
consistent good predictive accuracy, and it almost always outperforms C4.5 and
CBA. By using efficient, border-based algorithms (developed elsewhere) to
discover EPs, CAEP scales up on data volume and dimensionality. Observing that
accuracy on the whole dataset is too coarse description of classifiers, we also
used a more accurate measure, sensitivity and precision , to better characterize
the performance of classifiers. CAEP is also very good under this measure.},

	Abstract = {Classification aims to discover a model from training data that
can be used to predict the class of test instances. In this paper, we propose
the use of jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) as the basis for a new classifier
called the JEP-Classifier . Each JEP can capture some crucial difference
between a pair of datasets. Then, aggregating all JEPs of large supports can
produce a more potent classification power. Procedurally, the JEP-Classifier
learns the pair-wise features (sets of JEPs) contained in the training data,
and uses the collective impacts contributed by the most expressive pair-wise
features to determine the class labels of the test data. Using only the most
expressive JEPs in the JEP-Classifier strengthens its resistance to noise in
the training data, and reduces its complexity (as there are usually a very
large number of JEPs). We use two algorithms for constructing the
JEP-Classifier which are both scalable and efficient. These algorithms make
use of the border representation to efficiently store and manipulate JEPs. We
also present experimental results which show that the JEP-Classifier achieves
much higher testing accuracies than the association-based classifier of (Liu

The semantics of such rules are improved by introducing imprecise terms in both the antecedent and the

@article{creighton03,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Global gene expression profiling, both at
the transcript level and at the protein level, can be a
valuable tool in the understanding of genes, biological
networks, and cellular states. As larger and larger gene 
expression data sets become available, data mining techniques can
be applied to identify patterns of interest in the data.
Association rules, used widely in the area of market basket
analysis, can be applied to the analysis of expression data as
well. Association rules can reveal biologically relevant 
associations between different genes or between environmental
effects and gene expression. An association rule has the form
LHS ⇒ RHS, where LHS and
RHS are disjoint sets of items, the RHS set
being likely to occur whenever the LHS set occurs.
Items in gene expression data can include genes that are highly
expressed or repressed, as well as relevant facts describing the
cellular environment of the genes (e.g. the diagnosis of a tumor
sample from which a profile was obtained).Results: We demonstrate an algorithm for efficiently
mining association rules from gene expression data, using the
data set from Hughes et al. (2000,
Cell, 102, 109--126) of 300 expression
profiles for yeast. Using the algorithm, we find numerous rules 
in the data. A cursory analysis of some of these rules reveals
numerous associations between certain genes, many of which make
sense biologically, others suggesting new hypotheses that may
warrant further investigation. In a data set derived from the
yeast data set, but with the expression values for each
transcript randomly shifted with respect to the experiments, no
rules were found, indicating that most all of the rules mined
from the actual data set are not likely to have occurred by
chance. Availability: An implementation of the algorithm using
Microsoft SQL Server with Access 2000 is available at http://dot.ped.med.umich.edu:2000/pub/assoc\_rules/assoc\_rules.zip.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a significant signaling intermediary that 
regulates metabolisms in response to energy demand and supply. An investigation into the degree of activation and 
deactivation of AMPK subunits under exercise can provide valuable data for understanding AMPK. In particular, the 
effect of AMPK on muscle cellular energy status makes this protein a promising pharmacological target for disease 
treatment. As more AMPK regulation data are accumulated, data mining techniques can play an important role in 
identifying frequent patterns in the data. Association rule mining, which is commonly used in market basket analysis, 
can be applied to AMPK regulation.RESULTS:This paper proposes a framework that can identify the potential correlation, 
either between the state of isoforms of alpha, beta and gamma subunits of AMPK, or between stimulus factors and the 
state of isoforms. Our approach is to apply item constraints in the closed interpretation to the itemset generation 
so that a threshold is specified in terms of the amount of results, rather than a fixed threshold value for all 
itemsets of all sizes. The derived rules from experiments are roughly analyzed. It is found that most of the extracted 
association rules have biological meaning and some of them were previously unknown. They indicate direction for further 
research.CONCLUSION:Our findings indicate that AMPK has a great impact on most metabolic actions that are related to energy 
demand and supply. Those actions are adjusted via its subunit isoforms under specific physical training. Thus, there are 
strong co-relationships between AMPK subunit isoforms and exercises. Furthermore, the subunit isoforms are correlated with 
each other in some cases. The methods developed here could be used when predicting these essential relationships and enable 
an understanding of the functions and metabolic pathways regarding AMPK.},

@article{gyenesei07,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Association pattern discovery (APD) methods have been successfully applied to gene expression data. 
They find groups of co-regulated genes in which the genes are either up- or down-regulated throughout the identified conditions. 
These methods, however, fail to identify similarly expressed genes whose expressions change between up- and down-regulation from one condition to another. 
In order to discover these hidden patterns, we propose the concept of mining co-regulated gene profiles. 
Co-regulated gene profiles contain two gene sets such that genes within the same set behave identically (up or down)
while genes from different sets display contrary behavior. To reduce and group the large number of similar resulting patterns, 
we propose a new similarity measure that can be applied together with hierarchical clustering methods.Results: 
We tested our proposed method on two well-known yeast microarray data sets. 
Our implementation mined the data effectively and discovered patterns of co-regulated genes that are hidden to traditional APD methods. 
The high content of biologically relevant information in these patterns is demonstrated by the significant 
enrichment of co-regulated genes with similar functions. Our experimental results show that the Mining Attribute Profile (MAP) 
method is an efficient tool for the analysis of gene expression data and competitive with bi-clustering techniques.

	Abstract = {Frequent pattern discovery has become a popular solution to many
scientific and industrial problems in a range of different datasets.
Traditional algorithms, developed for binary (or Boolean) attributes, can be
applied to such data with a prerequisite of transforming non-binary
(continuous or categorical) attribute domains into binary ones. As a
consequence of this binarization, the discovered patterns no longer reflect
the associations between attributes but the relations between their binned
independent values, and thus, interactions between the original attributes
may be lost. In this paper we propose to overcome this limitation by
introducing the concept of mining frequent attribute profiles that describes
the relationships between the original attributes. By this concept,
previously hidden interactions can be discovered and redundant patterns that
are identified by traditional methods are eliminated. A novel algorithm,
called MAP, has been developed for m ining a ttribute p rofiles that can be
potentially applied to diverse data domains. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is shown by using gene expression or microarray data.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which trisomy 21 leads to the
characteristic Down syndrome (DS) phenotype are unclear. We used whole
genome microarrays to characterize for the first time the transcriptome
of human adult brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from seven
DS subjects and eight controls. These data were coanalyzed with a
publicly available dataset from fetal DS tissue and functional profiling
was performed to identify the biological processes central to DS and
those that may be related to late onset pathologies, particularly
Alzheimer disease neuropathology. A total of 685 probe sets were
differentially expressed between adult DS and control brains at a
stringent significance threshold (adjusted p value (q){\^{A}} \&lt;{\^{A}}
0.005), 70\% of these being up-regulated in DS. Over 25\% of genes on
chromosome 21 were differentially expressed in comparison to a median of
4.4\% for all chromosomes. The unique profile of up-regulation on
chromosome 21, consistent with primary dosage effects, was accompanied
by widespread transcriptional disruption. The critical Alzheimer disease
gene, APP, located on chromosome 21, was not found to be up-regulated in
adult brain by microarray or QPCR analysis. However, numerous other
genes functionally linked to APP processing were dysregulated.
Functional profiling of genes dysregulated in both fetal and adult
datasets identified categories including development (notably Notch
signaling and Dlx family genes), lipid transport, and cellular
proliferation. In the adult brain these processes were concomitant with
cytoskeletal regulation and vesicle trafficking categories, and
increased immune response and oxidative stress response, which are
likely linked to the development of Alzheimer pathology in individuals
with DS.},

believed to have many causes. Examples include Alzheimer disease,
diabetes mellitus, nicotine and alcohol dependence, and several cancers.
This study represents a paradigm shift from single gene to pathway
studies of complex diseases. We present the example of Parkinson disease
(PD) and a complex array of chemical signals that wires the brain during
fetal development (the axon guidance pathway). We mined a dataset that
studied hundreds of thousands of DNA variations (single nucleotide
polymorphisms [SNPs]) in persons with and without PD and identified SNPs
that were assigned to axon-guidance pathway genes. We then identified
sets of SNPs that were highly predictive of PD susceptibility, survival
free of PD, and age at onset of PD. The effect sizes and the statistical
significance observed for the pathway were far greater than for any
single gene. We validated our findings for the pathway using a second
SNP dataset for PD and also a dataset for PD that studied RNA
variations. There is prior evidence that the axon guidance pathway might
play a role in other brain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer disease, Tourette
syndrome, dyslexia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia). A genomic pathway
approach may lead to important breakthroughs for many complex
diseases.</p></sec>},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Prostate cancer is characterized by heterogeneity
in the clinical course that often does not correlate with morphologic
features of the tumor. Metastasis reflects the most adverse outcome of
prostate cancer, and to date there are no reliable morphologic features
or serum biomarkers that can reliably predict which patients are at
higher risk of developing metastatic disease. Understanding the
differences in the biology of metastatic and organ confined primary
tumors is essential for developing new prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets.METHODS:Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, we
analyzed gene expression profiles of 24 androgen-ablation resistant
metastatic samples obtained from 4 patients and a previously published
dataset of 64 primary prostate tumor samples. Differential gene
expression was analyzed after removing potentially uninformative stromal
genes, addressing the differences in cellular content between primary
and metastatic tumors.RESULTS:The metastatic samples are highly
heterogenous in expression; however, differential expression analysis
shows that 415 genes are upregulated and 364 genes are downregulated at
least 2 fold in every patient with metastasis. The expression profile of
metastatic samples reveals changes in expression of a unique set of
genes representing both the androgen ablation related pathways and other
metastasis related gene networks such as cell adhesion, bone remodelling
and cell cycle. The differentially expressed genes include metabolic
enzymes, transcription factors such as Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1) and cell
adhesion molecules such as Osteopontin (SPP1).CONCLUSION:We hypothesize
that these genes have a role in the biology of metastatic disease and
that they represent potential therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.},

five million people worldwide. Laboratory tests for PD are critically
needed for developing treatments designed to slow or prevent progression
of the disease. We performed a transcriptome-wide scan in 105
individuals to interrogate the molecular processes perturbed in cellular
blood of patients with early-stage PD. The molecular multigene marker
here identified is associated with risk of PD in 66 samples of the
training set comprising healthy and disease controls [third tertile
cross-validated odds ratio of 5.7 (P for trend 0.005)]. It is further
validated in 39 independent test samples [third tertile odds ratio of
5.1 (P for trend 0.04)]. Insights into disease-linked processes
detectable in peripheral blood are offered by 22 unique genes
differentially expressed in patients with PD versus healthy individuals.
These include the cochaperone ST13, which stabilizes heat-shock protein
70, a modifier of {\OE}\pm-synuclein misfolding and toxicity. ST13
messenger RNA copies are lower in patients with PD (mean ¬\pm SE 0.59

is still unknown but there is growing evidence that a combination of
both oxidative injury and genetic factors may play a role. One particle
hypothesis proposes that dysregulation of multiple genes in response to
an oxidative injury could contribute to the development of AMD. While
direct examination of ocular cells from AMD patients is difficult, AMD
also appears to have a systemic component. Therefore, as is the case
with other central nervous diseases, peripheral sites may also manifest
any underlying genetic abnormalities. For the present study,
biopsy-derived fibroblasts from 4 patients with the early form and 4
patients with the late form of AMD and 3 age-matched control patients
were grown in culture and treated with a nonlethal dose of the oxidative
stimulus menadione. Gene expression patterns were quantitatively and
qualitatively examined using Human Genome U95A GeneChips (Affymetrix)
and verified by real-time PCR analysis. In response to the oxidative
injury 755 genes were found to be upregulated at least twofold in one of
the patients groups. Cluster analysis of expression profiles detected
six patterns of dysregulation initiated by oxidative injury specific for
the disease groups (98 genes total). Clusters of genes dysregulated by
the sublethal oxidative injury in either early and/or late AMD groups

from 0.0393 to 0.00018) in both AMD patients groups in response to the
oxidative injury. Despite the small number of patients in the study,
specific biological and statistical differences in gene expression

state of the cell, by monitoring the expression level of thousands of
genes at the same time. It is of interest to develop techniques for
extracting useful information from the resulting data sets. Here we
report the application of a two-way clustering method for analyzing a
data set consisting of the expression patterns of different cell types.
Gene expression in 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was
analyzed with an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array complementary to more
than 6,500 human genes. An efficient two-way clustering algorithm was
applied to both the genes and the tissues, revealing broad coherent
patterns that suggest a high degree of organization underlying gene
expression in these tissues. Coregulated families of genes clustered
together, as demonstrated for the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also
separated cancerous from noncancerous tissue and cell lines from in vivo
tissues on the basis of subtle distributed patterns of genes even when
expression of individual genes varied only slightly between the tissues.
Two-way clustering thus may be of use both in classifying genes into
functional groups and in classifying tissues based on gene expression.},

subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of
patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival,
whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this
variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular
heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a
systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies.
Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the
tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour
proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the
tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had
gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell
differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal
centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type
expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of
peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with
germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival
than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of

BACKGROUND:

Microarray experiments are generating datasets that can help in reconstructing gene networks. One of the most important problems in network reconstruction is finding, for each gene in the network, which genes can affect it and how. We use a supervised learning approach to address this question by building decision-tree-related classifiers, which predict gene expression from the expression data of other genes.



RESULTS:

We present algorithms that work for continuous expression levels and do not require a priori discretization. We apply our method to publicly available data for the budding yeast cell cycle. The obtained classifiers can be presented as simple rules defining gene interrelations. In most cases the extracted rules confirm the existing knowledge about cell-cycle gene expression, while hitherto unknown relationships can be treated as new hypotheses.



CONCLUSIONS:

All the relations between the considered genes are consistent with the facts reported in the literature. This indicates that the approach presented here is valid and that the resulting rules can be used as elements for building and explaining gene networks.

	Abstract = {We introduce a method of functionally classifying genes by using gene expression data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. The method is based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are considered a supervised computer learning method because they exploit prior knowledge of gene function to identify unknown genes of similar function from expression data. SVMs avoid several problems associated with unsupervised clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps. SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis, including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function, sparseness of solution when dealing with large data sets, the ability to handle large feature spaces, and the ability to identify outliers. We test several SVMs that use different similarity metrics, as well as some other supervised learning methods, and find that the SVMs best identify sets of genes with a common function using expression data. Finally, we use SVMs to predict functional roles for uncharacterized yeast ORFs based on their expression data.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association-rules discovery (ARD) technique has yet
to be applied to gene-expression data analysis. Even in the absence
of previous biological knowledge, it should identify sets of genes
whose expression is correlated. The first association-rule miners
appeared six years ago and proved efficient at dealing with sparse
and weakly correlated data. A huge international research effort
has led to new algorithms for tackling difficult contexts and these
are particularly suited to analysis of large gene-expression matrices.
To validate the ARD technique we have applied it to freely available
human serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. RESULTS: The
approach described here enables us to designate sets of strong association
rules. We normalized the SAGE data before applying our association
rule miner. Depending on the discretization algorithm used, different
properties of the data were highlighted. Both common and specific
interpretations could be made from the extracted rules. In each and
every case the extracted collections of rules indicated that a very
strong co-regulation of mRNA encoding ribosomal proteins occurs in
the dataset. Several rules associating proteins involved in signal
transduction were obtained and analyzed, some pointing to yet-unexplored
directions. Furthermore, by examining a subset of these rules, we
were able both to reassign a wrongly labeled tag, and to propose
a function for an expressed sequence tag encoding a protein of unknown
function. CONCLUSIONS: We show that ARD is a promising technique

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Associative classification mining is a promising approach
in data mining that utilizes the association rule discovery techniques
to construct classification systems, also known as associative classifiers.
In the last few years, a number of associative classification algorithms
have been proposed, i.e. CPAR, CMAR, MCAR, MMAC and others. These
algorithms employ several different rule discovery, rule ranking,
rule pruning, rule prediction and rule evaluation methods. This paper
focuses on surveying and comparing the state-of-the-art associative
classification techniques with regards to the above criteria. Finally,
future directions in associative classification, such as incremental
learning and mining low-quality data sets, are also highlighted in
this paper. },

@article{varadan06,
	Abstract = {Computational analysis of gene expression data from microarrays has
been useful for medical diagnosis and prognosis. The ability to analyze
such data at the level of biological modules, rather than individual
genes, has been recognized as important for improving our understanding
of disease-related pathways. It has proved difficult, however, to
infer pathways from microarray data by deriving modules of multiple
synergistically interrelated genes, rather than individual genes.
Here we propose a systems-based approach called Entropy Minimization
and Boolean Parsimony (EMBP) that identifies, directly from gene
expression data, modules of genes that are jointly associated with
disease. Furthermore, the technique provides insight into the underlying
biomolecular logic by inferring a logic function connecting the joint
expression levels in a gene module with the outcome of disease. Coupled
with biological knowledge, this information can be useful for identifying
disease-related pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches
for interfering with the functions of such pathways. We present an
example providing such gene modules associated with prostate cancer
from publicly available gene expression data, and we successfully
validate the results on additional independently derived data. Our
results indicate a link between prostate cancer and cellular damage
from oxidative stress combined with inhibition of apoptotic mechanisms
normally triggered by such damage.},

@article{thummalapenta11,
	Abstract = {To improve software quality, static or dynamic defect-detection tools accept programming rules as 
input and detect their violations in software as defects. As these programming rules are often not well documented 
in practice, previous work developed various approaches that mine programming rules as frequent patterns from program source code. 
Then these approaches use static or dynamic defect-detection techniques to detect pattern violations in source code under analysis. 
However, these existing approaches often produce many false positives due to various factors. 
To reduce false positives produced by these mining approaches, we develop a novel approach, called Alattin, that includes new mining 
algorithms and a technique for detecting neglected conditions based on our mining algorithm. Our new mining algorithms mine patterns 
in four pattern formats: conjunctive, disjunctive, exclusive-disjunctive, and combinations of these patterns. 
We show the benefits and limitations of these four pattern formats with respect to false positives and false negatives among 
detected violations by applying those patterns to the problem of detecting neglected conditions.},

In contrast to traditional learning methods, our mining algorithm can detect inductive invariants as well as illegal state cubes. These invariants can be arbitrary boolean expressions and can thus prune a large don't care space during equivalence checking. Experimental results demonstrate that these general invariants can be very effective for sequential equivalence checking of circuits with no or very few equivalent signals between them, with low computational costs.},
